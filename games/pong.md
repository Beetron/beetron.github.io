title: "Pong clone"
---
This is my basic Pong clone. Unfortunately you cannot play this here, since its a Windows game only. I think I made it in 2014, so this is one of my first attempts at solo game development after university. It uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) as a framework, and the code is written in C++. It has a basic "AI" that you play against, but it really just follows the ball loosely.
