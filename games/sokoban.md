title: "Sokoban clone"
---
This is a little [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) clone I built in 2016. It uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) as a framework, and the code is written in C++. I only made a few levels, but my proudest achievement is building a prototype for a level editor.
