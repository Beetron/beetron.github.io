**How to play:** Left click and drag to hit the ball.

This is my 2D golf game. Not sure exactly how long it took to make but my estimate is around 2-3 weeks of development spread over a few months. This game was my first made in Godot, and I think the engine was pretty easy to use and I could see potential in it.
