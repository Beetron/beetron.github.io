This is my endless runner game. I wanted to learn how to structure a game using HTML5's canvas, without any external libraries. I worked on it sporadically from 2017-2019. I made a terrible run animation and I've decided to leave it for fun. My favourite part about this game is I used emoji's as the hearts.
