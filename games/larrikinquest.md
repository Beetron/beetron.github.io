**A (very) short 2D action-RPG featuring a crocodile-dundee kinda dude.** 

<a href="{{ site.url }}/games/larrikinquest/LarrikinQuest.zip">DOWNLOAD HERE</a>  

I'm only supporting Windows Desktop for this game at this stage.

Developed between June 2020 - November 2020.

Utilized the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), made all the sprites with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), and created the sound effects with [bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/).
