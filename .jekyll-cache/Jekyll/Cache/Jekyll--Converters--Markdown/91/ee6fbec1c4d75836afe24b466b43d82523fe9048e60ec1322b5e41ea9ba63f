I"©<p>This is my basic Pong clone. I think I made it in 2014, so this is one of my first attempts at solo game development after university. It uses <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> as a framework, and the code is written in C++. It has a basic â€œAIâ€ that you play against, but it really just follows the ball loosely.
